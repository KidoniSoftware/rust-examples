# Rust Examples
This repository contains miscellaneous basic examples using Rust, often "porting" work I've done elsewhere in Java.
The intent is learning Rust ... e.g. how would I do something in Rust that I know how to do or have done in Java. 
As such, the Rust code may not be "good" Rust while I learn Rust idioms and features.
